/**
 *Number of ways to get a sum n
 * by 1,2,3 rupee coin
 *
 * if you have infinite supply of coin
 *
 * say n=5
 * (1,1,1,1,1)
 * (1,1,1,2)
 * (1,1,3)
 * (1,2,2)
 * (2,3)
 *
 * anather question could be find the minimum num of coin required ie 2 in above case
 *
 * if can be solved by recursion but time complexity is higer
 *
 * but if we do it by com.algo.dynamic programming we can store the result and use it further
 *
 *
 * N = 4 and S = {1,2,3},
 * there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.
 * So output should be 4.
 * For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6},
 * there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}
